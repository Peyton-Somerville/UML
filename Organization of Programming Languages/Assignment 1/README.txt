OPL Assignment 1 README:

• What was easy?
The C# program was pretty easy to comment since it is very similar to C and C++.
The OCaml program was also easy to comment because it is intuitive.
Writing the original program was somewhat easy aswell since python is very simple.


• What was hard?
I found Ada to be the hardest to comment.
Prolog was also hard to comment because it uses a lot of functions that I am not 
sure the functionality of.


• Are there noticeable differences in speed?
The only difference in speed that I noticed was in python, it displayed the print 
statements as the were written instead of all at the end.


• What do you like/dislike?
I liked writing the code in python. I also liked just seeing basically the same program 
in all these different languages, it is very interesting. There was nothing I disliked 
about this assignment.


• Compare the data representation used for the matrices in each of your five programs
(e.g., arrays, lists, …), and comment on how the data representation affected the
implementation of the matrix multiplication algorithm.
In python I used a list of lists, which works with the multiplication algorithm by 
accessing elements using x[i][j] and using a triple for-loop.

In C# a 2D array is used, which made accessing elements a little simpler than python by 
using x[i, j] and a triple for-loop.

OCaml uses arrays and similarly to python and C# uses a triple for-loop and accesses each 
element using a.(i).(j).

Ada seems to have built in matrix capabilities, it can declare a matrix A and B and just 
do A * B for the matrix multiplication.

Prolog seems to be similar to Ada and just has already made functions to take in matrices 
and return matrix multiplication results. It internally uses a list of lists.
